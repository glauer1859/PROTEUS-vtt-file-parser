00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.909
112R-003: Hi Darren.

2
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.380
112T-008: Hi! How are you doing, Joe?

3
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.839
112R-003: Good. I was wondering who that was, because I don't know.

4
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.490
112T-008: Right.

5
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.130
112T-008: It sort of automatically came up with my code today. So it's.

6
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.540
112R-003: Oh, that's really interesting.

7
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.090
112R-003: Okay.

8
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.329
112R-003: good to know.

9
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.480
112R-003: Hi, Isa. I don't know if you can hear me if you're all the way logged in, yet

10
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.740
112R-003: usually takes me like a half hour of getting all my settings right.

11
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.090
112R-003: See. How do I do that, too.

12
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.950
112R-003: at some point.

13
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.350
112R-003: Yeah. Mine did not

14
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.089
112R-003: prompt me to do that, I have no idea. Let's see.

15
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.979
112R-003: there we go. I got it.

16
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.390
112R-003: Hi! Isa!

17
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.820
112S-002: I know we are supposed to change our names to the special wording. I just don't remember what my code was.

18
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.200
112R-003: Yeah. Oh, neither do I. I just had to look it up. I'll

19
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.280
112R-003: I'll share that. And one of the things that I actually discovered last time

20
00:06:54.797 --> 00:07:11.889
112R-003: is in. I don't remember if it was this meeting or a different star team meeting, but we didn't change our names over to our participant numbers until much later in the meeting. And yet the transcript reflect like backfilled the changes.

21
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.350
112R-003: So

22
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:25.270
112R-003: yeah, it just means a little bit less work like Vilma and I, literally today have been interviewing some Ra's to help with cleaning these transcripts.

23
00:07:26.081 --> 00:07:31.690
112R-003: And so we're just trying to save the Ra's work wherever we can, and cleaning the transcripts. And

24
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.440
112R-003: so, anyway, that was a that was a pleasant discovery.

25
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.340
112R-003: How are you doing, David?

26
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.040
112A-005: I'm doing really well, Joe, thank you.

27
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.680
112A-005: It it was nice to have the link in the

28
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:56.279
112A-005: in the deal. I'm sorry in the calendar invite, because I just it just popped right up and I could open it. So thank you for that.

29
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.570
112A-005: Okay, yeah.

30
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.140
112R-003: Trying to per perfect my technique here.

31
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.540
112A-005: Well, there's a lot of, and there's a huge number of details. So

32
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.850
112A-005: I'm impressed with everything that you're doing.

33
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:17.080
112R-003: Well, today I'll I'll tell you anybody who has words of wisdom. Because the next, the next big thing we have

34
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:30.640
112R-003: on the order of 60 students who are have volunteered now to do interviews for the questions that we develop as teams to test out and see what happens when the students answer these questions.

35
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.890
112R-003: and

36
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.289
112R-003: there's gonna be some complex scheduling tetris

37
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:48.090
112R-003: with all of those interviews. So if you have any past experience about the which tools have used, and the way you've used them to allow people to select their appointment slots and any

38
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:53.540
112R-003: to do's and 2 don'ts that you've discovered along the way, I would be all ears on those.

39
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.400
112A-005: So are you trying to get together groups? Or is it just.

40
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.719
112R-003: No, it's a single. It's a single student.

41
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.530
112A-005: Okay.

42
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.530
112R-003: Interviewee.

43
00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:05.349
112A-005: Interviewing with you and Vilma.

44
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.619
112R-003: Well, yes, at 1st it'll probably be just me and Vilma, but then it'll probably be me or Vilma.

45
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.390
112R-003: and maybe an Ra.

46
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.769
112R-003: For technical support.

47
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.773
112A-005: Yeah. So

48
00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.759
112A-005: I've used calendly to have students.

49
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.790
112A-005: you know.

50
00:09:24.792 --> 00:09:25.909
112A-005: Set up appointments

51
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.060
112A-005: with me. It's free. I mean, there is a free version.

52
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:35.050
112A-005: It's pretty easy to use, and I was, you know, pretty satisfied with the way it works, like when a student

53
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.930
112A-005: signs up for an appointment, you get a, you get an email.

54
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.960
112A-005: and it goes into onto your calendar as well.

55
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.720
112R-003: Gotcha.

56
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:43.530
112R-003: Okay.

57
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.789
112A-005: I know there's I mean people. There's a lot of these things that people use successfully. So

58
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.659
112A-005: that's just the one that I've used in the past.

59
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.510
112R-003: I've heard some good things about it, and I haven't used it yet, so. But.

60
00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:00.349
112T-008: I'm I'm using. You can book me for the same, essentially the same purpose. It probably is very similar.

61
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.149
112R-003: You can book me is the name of the application.

62
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.449
112T-008: Exactly. It's a website. You can book me.com. I think it is.

63
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.880
112R-003: Calendly. You can book me.

64
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.520
112A-005: Hmm.

65
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:16.480
112R-003: Hi Jennifer.

66
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.810
112A-005: Everybody be on their best behavior because I'm taking names.

67
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.319
112A-005: I mean, I'm taking notes, taking.

68
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.210
112R-003: Which is a good point. So let me.

69
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:47.690
112R-003: and with ease of what you were talking about, like none of us knows what our our special representative numbers are yet, or strings, I guess. So let me go ahead and open up the meeting log and share that.

70
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.429
112R-003: and show again how to find those and change those.

71
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.429
112R-003: So I just posted the meeting

72
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.699
112R-003: agenda link in the chat.

73
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.119
112R-003: and one of the things that we did is right at the top of our meeting notes.

74
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.339
112R-003: There is a link straight to the team directory.

75
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.010
112R-003: right at the very top of the document.

76
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.460
112R-003: and I'll share my screen as I'm doing it.

77
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:39.190
112R-003: And so in theory here, if I go into that team directory

78
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.109
112R-003: and then I go down to the tabs to our Ula tab down here.

79
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.920
112R-003: then I can see what my.

80
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.220
112R-003: what my idea is. So that's where they're all kind of grouped there.

81
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:13.139
112R-003: Anybody had anything adventurous, exciting, or unexpected happen in the last few days.

82
00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:22.860
112A-005: I drove 3,500 miles in the last, you know, week or 10 days or so.

83
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.640
112R-003: 3,500.

84
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.409
112A-005: Yeah, it was great.

85
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.050
112R-003: Goodness!

86
00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.319
112R-003: I'm curious.

87
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.280
112A-005: I went. I went and visited my family, and then

88
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.889
112A-005: came back and did some sightseeing. So it was really nice.

89
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.870
112R-003: Gotcha.

90
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.020
112R-003: I went to Washington, DC. For the 1st time.

91
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:51.470
112R-003: Yeah. Last last week I went to Washington, DC. For the 1st time. I was at a conference there. And so I

92
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.410
112R-003: I actually

93
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:58.410
112R-003: touched or actually it was a slap. I'm going to say it was more of a slap. The Washington Monument.

94
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.983
112R-003: It didn't fall over it.

95
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:02.010
112A-005: Thank goodness.

96
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.950
112R-003: It's very, very large.

97
00:13:04.536 --> 00:13:06.913
112R-003: It's much larger than I realized.

98
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.639
112A-005: So. So you had some time for sightseeing. Then.

99
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.180
112R-003: Just that one afternoon, really.

100
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.570
112R-003: yeah.

101
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:19.119
112A-005: It's such a fun fun place to visit, because there's so much you can just drop into. You.

102
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.761
112T-008: Last time I was there I was with about 68th graders. So that was,

103
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.139
112T-008: maybe a little less fun. My son's school.

104
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.550
112R-003: A lot of 8th graders. Darren.

105
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.179
112T-008: Yeah, I was only in charge of.

106
00:13:36.433 --> 00:13:36.939
112R-003: Be about.

107
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:37.590
112A-005: There's.

108
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.039
112R-003: I'd be evaluating my decisions.

109
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.885
112T-008: The bus trip was kind of brutal from Michigan, but.

110
00:13:44.813 --> 00:13:45.260
112A-005: Hi, Jeff!

111
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.000
112R-003: Sure.

112
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:56.429
112S-002: I have had nothing interesting happen recently, but I'm excited for this week, because it's homecoming week at my school.

113
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.820
112R-003: Oh, very fun!

114
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.310
112S-002: Yes.

115
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.810
112A-005: I'm sorry I forgotten. So so you're on the a dance.

116
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:07.880
112A-005: Yes.

117
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.219
112S-002: So I'm on the dance team. So

118
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.590
112S-002: a lot of stuff that we'll do a lot of appearances. So like we, a lot of the towns like, throw a lot of

119
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:30.660
112S-002: things in town, throw parties and stuff, and we just go and cheer. And then on Friday we have our big bonfire with a concert. So we dance at that, and then our football game, and that's just a big party.

120
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.350
112A-005: Nice.

121
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.920
112A-005: does your

122
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.369
112R-003: Yeah, what about you? Anything interesting going on.

123
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:47.739
112S-001: This week the most interesting thing would be. I really like cooking and baking.

124
00:14:47.770 --> 00:15:06.160
112S-001: So I got a new bread maker, and I was planning on making like a chocolate bread thing. But I haven't decided on the recipe yet, but I've been like planning out all week how I can make this really good chocolate bread. So I'm excited, for when I like finish it.

125
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.100
112S-001: that's extreme.

126
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.680
112A-005: These meetings aren't in person.

127
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.785
112R-003: Yes.

128
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:30.780
112R-003: so well. Hello, everyone welcome once again. I had I I had a couple of little things that I wanted to share primarily the 1st thing which I've done which is to make to. I put a big reminder for myself at the top of the notes, which let me repost.

129
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.300
112R-003: Make sure everybody copy.

130
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.359
112R-003: There's a link to our meeting agenda, which is much less

131
00:15:38.550 --> 00:16:01.749
112R-003: agenda E. This week. You'll notice we're not trying to drive the boat nearly so much. But I I wanted to put that reminder to make sure we share our or change our names to our Ids, which we have done so that the transcripts will be cleaner, for, so that the dozens and dozens and dozens of transcripts that are generated by this project are easier to clean for all of our research assistants.

132
00:16:02.155 --> 00:16:05.840
112R-003: And the second thing that I wanted to share was, actually.

133
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:20.899
112R-003: we conducted film and I conducted on Friday, a pilot, a test drive of our interview protocol, which is the the interview, the set of interview questions that we're going to be asking of students once. This team has some questions that they're ready to

134
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:39.379
112R-003: like, hey, fly these test and see how they go. Let's see what students actually do when they try answering our questions. So the. This was a calculus example. So it's not a linear algebra example. It's a calculus example. But there is in the meeting log. You will see.

135
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.889
112R-003: Maybe I'll just share my screen.

136
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:53.559
112R-003: and I guess we can do this, however, makes sense. I don't know if it would work for us to actually play it, live and watch it all simultaneously. We can give it a shot.

137
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.940
112R-003: and if that doesn't work we can just kind of.

138
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:06.019
112R-003: Take a break and each download and watch it offline, if need be, or something like that. I'm not sure how it would work. We can give it a try, though. But you'll see here, this

139
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:12.160
112R-003: sample of our initial cognitive interview pilot that happened on Friday. And so what I did is I

140
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:22.809
112R-003: actually clipped out about 7 min of it. It's not done elegantly. I don't know anything about video editing. I just literally sliced it up with ffmpeg

141
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:31.579
112R-003: and used python deface to blur the faces because I didn't have my zoom settings correct, anyway. So it's just a little sample.

142
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:37.460
112R-003: and let me just give it. Give it a try to see what happens if it can play for us. During the meeting.

143
00:17:38.556 --> 00:17:51.979
112A-005: If you don't mind me asking. So you know, as as a note taker, I just wanna make sure I'm sort of aware of the expectation. So so we're mainly just gonna track

144
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.980
112A-005: things that we want like things that are action

145
00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.880
112A-005: items. Right? So I mean, I wouldn't have notes like, Oh, we watched the video, or something like that, is that.

146
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:14.389
112R-003: Not necessarily. No, you don't have to. Actually, it doesn't have to be a true like a play by play kind of thing, any anything that the note taker says. Hmm! That's I think that's interesting or salient.

147
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:35.059
112R-003: Take it down, and that that'll vary a little bit by notetaker. But the pressure is off because we're recording. Right? So if there's something that we realize after the fact, oh, that whole thing we discussed about Orthogonality, nobody wrote anything down. It's okay. We have a recording, right? So it don't feel too much pressure whenever it's your turn as notetaker. And thank you for asking that.

148
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:39.920
112A-005: Okay? And and then there's a section on here that says questions

149
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:45.350
112A-005: for the project coordinators. So the project coordinators are you? And Vilma? Is that.

150
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.820
112R-003: Basically ye yes.

151
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.650
112R-003: ish

152
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.800
112R-003: everybody in kind of the the project. Pi umbrella.

153
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.679
112A-005: Okay, it comes.

154
00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.650
112R-003: It could cause. It could be a technical, a technical question that transcends Vilma. And I,

155
00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.360
112R-003: right?

156
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:07.259
112R-003: basically anything that's like, there's we have a question that's outside the scope of this star team. Anything like that would go there.

157
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.820
112A-005: Okay, great. Thank you so much.

158
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:17.119
112R-003: All right, cross your fingers. I'm gonna see if I can play this video clip of this sample cognitive interview. We'll see what happens.

159
00:19:23.453 --> 00:19:24.820
112R-003: Hold on.

160
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.500
112R-003: I realized that I stopped sharing.

161
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.860
112R-003: And can I just share?

162
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:54.230
112R-003: I might have to specifically request it shares with audio. I don't know if it automatically will do that. Let me just play it for a second. Give me a thumbs up if you're getting audio off of it. Okay.

163
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.960
112R-003: no, no audio. Okay.

164
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:08.080
112R-003: how do we share this with audio?

165
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.570
112R-003: Oh, share sound?

166
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.019
112R-003: Okay, let me try it again.

167
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.539
112R-003: So how you arrived at your answer?

168
00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:29.159
112R-003: Yeah. So just kind of like thinking of a definition of a derivative F of X plus h, minus F of X.

169
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:33.570
112R-003: In this case I kind of thought of F of X plus h as F of B,

170
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:39.970
112R-003: and then by saying, they're like infinitely close. That's kind of how

171
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:45.930
112R-003: the limit. As H approaches 0 is thought of right? So F of x plus H

172
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.010
112R-003: and H approaching 0,

173
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.609
112R-003: it's just F of X, because they're infinitely close. Basically

174
00:20:54.770 --> 00:21:00.700
112R-003: yeah. And then we divide by H, which is the which is the difference between B and A,

175
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:05.719
112R-003: and since they're infinitely close, it approaches 0. So like kind of like the limit.

176
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:11.040
112R-003: What in the question was either surprising or confusing for you?

177
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:24.799
112R-003: And I guess the part that says, How do we know that? Yeah. So how do we know? I feel like I would think like, oh, we already know that there's like

178
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.810
112R-003: no definition, I guess.

179
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:35.499
112R-003: because, like, we just take the derivative plug in a and we find the slope. I've never thought of that. How do we know?

180
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:42.379
112R-003: I always took it like, Oh, it's obvious. But yeah, going back to like the definition of the derivative.

181
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:47.710
112R-003: That's yeah. That's like, as we take 2 values that approach it. And that's how we find it.

182
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.339
112R-003: If you could, how would you modify the question? And why?

183
00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.260
112R-003: Hmm.

184
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.570
112R-003: instead of, putting how do we know i'd put y.

185
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.400
112R-003: why is

186
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:17.270
112R-003: So like, why is the slope of the tangent line

187
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.969
112R-003: to F of X at X equals a F prime of a

188
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.780
112R-003: that. Yeah, that. How do we know? Kind of like

189
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.810
112R-003: confused me a little, I guess like or maybe

190
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.369
112R-003: I'm not sure, actually, because

191
00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:39.479
112R-003: now that I read, how do we know? It kind of takes me back to the definition of a derivative.

192
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.059
112R-003: And if I like.

193
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.989
112R-003: and talking about replacing it with Y,

194
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.149
112R-003: I feel like I want to have gone back to the definition of the derivative

195
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.720
112R-003: just by having that. So

196
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:53.709
112R-003: I think,

197
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:56.670
112R-003: I think I'll just keep it the same. Actually.

198
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.570
112R-003: So you decide, maybe you wouldn't change it. Maybe you would keep it as

199
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.490
112R-003: yeah, I'd keep it.

200
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.020
112R-003: I think that's fine.

201
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:07.540
112R-003: Okay?

202
00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.549
112R-003: All right. So let's go ahead and look at the second question. Then.

203
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:20.279
112R-003: Oh, no, there's 1 more. I missed one. Sorry? Oh, sorry for that. Francisco. I have a question so

204
00:23:20.883 --> 00:23:24.169
112R-003: I found it very interesting when you say that? How do we?

205
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:33.919
112R-003: They were? How do we know make you go to the definition? Whereas the why didn't make you go to the definition? Say a little bit more.

206
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.510
112R-003: Hmm.

207
00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:42.589
112R-003: hmm! I feel like y would have just like taken me to like higher level. So like just

208
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.359
112R-003: doing the power rules. So, for example, for the second question.

209
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:51.969
112R-003: just doing 4, 4, minus 2 XI feel like I would have explained it that way. So like

210
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.310
112R-003: maybe use something like

211
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.020
112R-003: that. Instead of the definition.

212
00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:08.909
112R-003: I think, how do we know it actually like? Took me back and like helped me explain everything better, more clearly in your own words. Please tell us what the question is asking.

213
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:24.360
112R-003: So it's saying, apply the limit. Definition that instantly made me think of F of x plus h minus F of X over H, and it also, oh, something that really like

214
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:39.840
112R-003: made me think about it is that it had the h divided at the end. The limit of H is also a big part, but that dividing by H. Since I like already knew the formula, I know it divides by H, so yeah, just copy

215
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.280
112R-003: the top part

216
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:48.899
112R-003: and evaluate the limit. It's just finding the slope at 0. So take the derivative.

217
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.460
112R-003: And or, oh.

218
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:58.140
112R-003: yeah, so it says, evaluate the limit. But I know evaluating this limit is just the derivative at

219
00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:05.349
112R-003: F prime of 0 or or at 0. So it just, I can just take the derivative and evaluate at 0.

220
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.730
112R-003: And yeah, basically same thing for the rest.

221
00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.809
112R-003: Okay, what was surprising in the question.

222
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.019
112R-003: I guess. The only like

223
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.370
112R-003: confusing part, maybe, was that

224
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:30.340
112R-003: I just thought evaluate the limit, and I wasn't sure if they wanted me to like solve this whole thing.

225
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.849
112R-003: Or if I could just take the derivative and plug in one edit.

226
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.630
112R-003: Okay.

227
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:47.020
112R-003: if you could, how would you modify the question? And why?

228
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.330
112R-003: Hmm.

229
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.320
112R-003: I think this is also fine. Maybe.

230
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:13.839
112R-003: maybe, like, add a note on the on the second part of evaluating a frame of one.

231
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.580
112R-003: because, like

232
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.179
112R-003: oh, I'm not sure, but, like

233
00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:30.649
112R-003: I like already, knew the power rule and things like that. I'm not sure if students would know the power rule at this point I'm guessing, not. So they would actually have to go through the process of the limit. So

234
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.298
112R-003: yeah, I think this is

235
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:39.639
112R-003: okay, I was just gonna follow up on what you said about evaluating the limit. If how would you do that

236
00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:44.129
112R-003: if like, I didn't know the power rule, I'm guessing sure.

237
00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:52.429
112R-003: yeah. So I would just like solve all this, try to get it as simple, as simple as possible.

238
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.580
112R-003: And then I'm gonna have

239
00:26:55.460 --> 00:27:00.390
112R-003: pretty long formula. I'm guessing it's going to be some factor of H over H,

240
00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.623
112R-003: so maybe I could cancel those out

241
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.470
112R-003: or if I have 0 over 0, go to Lopito's rule.

242
00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:13.250
112R-003: And yeah, just yeah. So look, oh, but

243
00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:18.729
112R-003: I'll take Lopito's rule. But I still got to take the derivative of the top and the bottoms.

244
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.290
112R-003: Okay, so that's an

245
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:30.429
112R-003: there's about 3 portions of the interview that I I really roughly displaced together there. So but you can kind of get a sense of the

246
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:43.410
112R-003: the flow, a little sampling of some of the items there. And so what you're seeing here is actually our 1st rough attempt. It actually just putting these questions in.

247
00:27:43.410 --> 00:28:09.629
112R-003: This was the active calculus runestone textbook. That's what you're actually seeing displayed. So this the student is actually seeing some quick little questions that we've put in to the active calculus, and they actually type their responses in those text boxes. And then we ask them follow up questions after they go through them. So, seeing this, our hope is that it would give you a little bit more concrete idea of what's going to happen with the questions that we develop. Where are they going to go from here?

248
00:28:09.951 --> 00:28:18.830
112R-003: And the the fact that it's gonna be pretty organic, what kind of feedback we get from the students. So I just wanna open it up for people to discuss like, what? Seeing this.

249
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:28.890
112R-003: what questions does this raise for you about the process? The the types of questions we need to be developing, how? How we need to be implementing them. Things like that.

250
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.609
112R-003: What thoughts and questions do you have.

251
00:28:42.526 --> 00:28:43.860
112S-001: So I have a thought.

252
00:28:44.330 --> 00:29:04.310
112S-001: It was during his 1st question when the student said that he didn't really like the word. No. But then he liked how it was phrased like, How do we know? And that it's really reminded me of my theory of knowledge class? It's taught in the ib like learning system.

253
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:30.400
112S-001: but they sort of like. There are different ways that we know things, and mathematical knowledge is like one of the ways we can construct knowledge. So I really liked how the question was phrased, and that same like thought process that he went through of thinking that like, why would they word it this way? And then, realizing that they want you to think in a particular way, it just reminded me of my own experience like as a student. So I did like that.

254
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:51.949
112T-007: I guess I'm just wondering, like, you know, the kind of how would you change the question?

255
00:29:53.490 --> 00:30:00.420
112T-007: I mean, it was that was really good. How that, you know. The soon thought they would change it in a certain way, and then realized maybe they wouldn't.

256
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:14.654
112T-007: But I like I I have a hard time imagining, like, I'm wondering if there's a way we could really get to like possible changes without. I just think I think a lot of students might just like, no, it's fine.

257
00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:20.649
112T-007: So I'm wondering like how to sort of dig into that right?

258
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:31.250
112T-007: Besides, just how would you change it. So I don't know. This is just a thought that occurred to me like, I can just imagine that

259
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.009
112T-007: students are kind of afraid to change things

260
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:39.539
112T-007: if they understood the question, they don't want to change it. If they didn't understand the question, then that's great.

261
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.040
112T-007: right? So

262
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.740
112T-007: maybe

263
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:54.389
112T-007: trying to get at like if they didn't do it the way it was anticipated. What might lead you to do it a different way or something, whether we can be more specific about that idea.

264
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.870
112R-003: So Joshua's comment is really kind of

265
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.020
112R-003: is really speaking to

266
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:09.200
112R-003: the composition of the question that we asked the student right? And Jennifer's question is really speaking to the composition of the protocol. Item.

267
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:15.419
112R-003: right? What do we ask the student about the question which is interesting? There's kind of concern at both levels. There.

268
00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:28.130
112S-002: Kind of to piggyback off of that. Sometimes when students think that

269
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:38.609
112S-002: they they want to change a question, I agree that sometimes they they want to change it, but they're afraid to change it, because they feel that the question they're asking is gonna

270
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:44.419
112S-002: create future contradictions and create more confusion. So sometimes I feel that

271
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.500
112S-002: which I don't know.

272
00:31:46.530 --> 00:32:05.329
112S-002: The student that was being interviewed like he started overthinking. Well, what if another kid thinks this? Or what if another kid misunderstands the question that I want like that he was trying to create, which? Why? Why? He went backwards to the original he was like, no, I think then, the original question is good, so I think sometimes

273
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:12.009
112S-002: they feel like wording when they want to change something. Their wording is going to create confusion or a contradiction that

274
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.189
112S-002: people might, that others might get confused about.

275
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.390
112S-002: If that makes sense.

276
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:34.779
112A-005: So I I personally thought this was really interesting, because you know, as someone who writes a lot of questions

277
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:47.769
112A-005: for their students, you know the the wording. What can seem like a small change in the wording can really seem. You know how how students interpret questions.

278
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.780
112A-005: you know, is something I mean, I've been teaching 30 some odd years.

279
00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:55.279
112A-005: and I still don't feel like I totally am able to predict

280
00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:01.779
112A-005: how they're going to be able to, how they interpret questions. So I thought, I'm really glad that came up, because

281
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.140
112A-005: that's something that I think about a lot. And I

282
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:09.170
112A-005: I'm hoping I can learn through this process more about

283
00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.709
112A-005: that, so that I thought that was kind of cool.

284
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:16.720
112A-005: I also sort of wondered a little bit, because this student was also bringing in

285
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:21.700
112A-005: things like the power rule and and things like Lopital's rule.

286
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:25.560
112A-005: that the students, you know that, I imagine

287
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.190
112A-005: when the students would be.

288
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.690
112A-005: you know. Answering these questions

289
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.119
112A-005: within the context of this course, they probably would not have seen those ideas

290
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.850
112A-005: before, so I sort of appreciated the acknowledgement

291
00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:47.439
112A-005: of that and and sort of well, I know the students probably wouldn't do this, but I mean, it's it's kind of something that I thought about, too like, how do we

292
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.710
112A-005: put ourselves into the position

293
00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.590
112A-005: of students that are in the middle of the course.

294
00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:01.420
112T-008: Related to what David was saying. One of the things I struggle with and continue to kind of

295
00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:06.099
112T-008: work my way through is helping students get beyond very minimalist sort of

296
00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:20.670
112T-008: responses to questions. And you know, I'll ask, why does this transformation have a certain property? Or how do you know? And they'll they'll say, Well, the rank is 2 or something, and they they won't say the rank of what or how they know. The rank is 2 or what the rank being 2 means about, you know. So they sort of

297
00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:22.630
112T-008: go for some very

298
00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:31.170
112T-008: sort of tourist response that doesn't get at the kind of connections I wanted them to make right. And so I think one thing I would like to learn more about

299
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:38.019
112T-008: is how to elicit response from students, that that kind of gets beyond just

300
00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.950
112T-008: whatever the they're they're

301
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.870
112T-008: 2 or 3 word

302
00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:53.306
112T-008: higher level reason would be, what? What are the implications of it? I think I think in in the video they were kind of getting at that a little bit right? I mean, if he gave a a short response it was then followed up with

303
00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:56.010
112T-008: a bit more clarity on what he what he meant.

304
00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:16.799
112R-003: And I think this student, this pilot student, had the the advantage of knowing he was piloting for the benefit of shaping this experience for other students to come after right. And this is a more mature mathematical suit. This is somebody who has been up and through multivariable calculus. They're not in calc. One.

305
00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.520
112R-003: and so they cannot.

306
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:22.370
112R-003: They cannot take off those goggles when they're looking at this question.

307
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.755
112R-003: which?

308
00:35:25.554 --> 00:35:36.830
112R-003: also, which kind of like Isa and David. Your comments came in on both sides of this, when the student is thinking like this student is also aware that other students, seeing the question have different goggles

309
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:43.089
112R-003: right? And it's 1 of my particular logistical questions.

310
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:47.159
112R-003: When we talked about on our 1st meeting, when we talked about

311
00:35:48.330 --> 00:36:01.779
112R-003: the like the nitty gritty of like. What do you like stating conjectures about? What do you think will be some of the pieces of the students thinking, What do you hope will be the pieces of students thinking and making those explicit? So we can, we know, to look for those

312
00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.340
112R-003: from what the team expects. But then, also

313
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.730
112R-003: this bit where

314
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:17.070
112R-003: we're, gonna we're going to make sure that a student has calculus exposure or has linear algebra exposure before they come into this interview process.

315
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:23.869
112R-003: right? Not just anybody can be in this experience. But they're gonna have varying levels. And so

316
00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.980
112R-003: is the

317
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.639
112R-003: the team. I guess the team needs to be aware of, or I'm not sure how we're

318
00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:40.910
112R-003: how specific we need to be, how constraining we need to be like this student really should only have calc. One knowledge, or this student should be a brand new Newbie person to the calculus sequence or

319
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:48.400
112R-003: things like that. I don't know. I'm I'm both stating it as something to consider. And I'm also asking, do we need to consider it? I don't know.

320
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:57.799
112R-003: It's been on my mind, though. That everybody's going to be coming in with different levels of experience. How does that impact? How they actually interact with these questions. So

321
00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.689
112R-003: there you go.

322
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.840
112R-003: any other thoughts or questions related to

323
00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.520
112R-003: this video or this cognitive interview process that we've seen a little

324
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:11.400
112R-003: preview of.

325
00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:27.809
112A-005: Well, I I guess I'll just say it was helpful to to see the video, to kind of imagine how this plays out later on. So I think I think this was a really good time

326
00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.490
112A-005: to share that with us.

327
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.550
112A-005: Okay.

328
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.549
112R-003: You can thank Vilma. That was Vilma's idea.

329
00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:37.080
112R-003: Villa said. We should show this to the star teams.

330
00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.897
112R-003: Vilma has all the best ideas.

331
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.630
112R-003: Okay?

332
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.649
112R-003: let's look at our very sparse agenda.

333
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:58.976
112R-003: which the next thing on our agenda says finalize which 3 topics to develop questions, for that's the only thing that I could have sketched in our in there.

334
00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:03.280
112R-003: And we can within our time constraint today.

335
00:38:03.734 --> 00:38:09.760
112R-003: We can get as as far in that as we as we get there's no particular

336
00:38:10.246 --> 00:38:32.209
112R-003: specific super concrete goal. We wanted our our initial concrete goal at this stage for all star teams is that by the end of the second meeting, which for us is this meeting that we would have congealed on and agreed on, and all these supporting approximately 3 topics that we want the initial wave of questions to sit within.

337
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.279
112R-003: Where where are those in the textbook?

338
00:38:35.818 --> 00:38:53.909
112R-003: Whether we actually congeal on that really quickly when we look back at our our slides and our ideas that we brainstorm last time. If we we come to that really quickly and we decide, hey? Yeah, I think these, this, this and this are great topics. And I have some ideas for questions I want to ask, and we want to dive right into that great. That's fine.

339
00:38:54.408 --> 00:39:06.399
112R-003: But really, the 1st stage is making sure, before we think about the specific questions, to make sure, we agree on the topic. Slash textbook zones they're gonna draw from. So that's where I would kind of like open us up to next.

340
00:39:06.809 --> 00:39:11.989
112R-003: Maybe I'll share. What I'll do is I'll share a screen with a brainstorming. We did on topics last time.

341
00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.459
112R-003: To help us with that discussion.

342
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.070
112R-003: These we had 3 slides.

343
00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.269
112R-003: And also here is a

344
00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.499
112R-003: link to that

345
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.560
112R-003: which I'll also put in the chat.

346
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:46.629
112R-003: There's also a link to this.

347
00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:51.100
112R-003: But we had our 3 different teams, and I actually don't remember

348
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:59.809
112R-003: who was on which that's not necessarily super super important. But we can see there's some places where we overlap in them

349
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.210
112R-003: in some places where people's ideas were unique. So

350
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:19.709
112R-003: thoughts on where you see overlaps where you see anything that you want to promote or suggest waits for the next wave, or anything like that.

351
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:30.639
112R-003: Not sure. Go ahead.

352
00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:37.589
112S-001: So I don't think we covered it here explicitly. But

353
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.700
112S-001: after like doing some research when we between the 2 meetings.

354
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:44.850
112S-001: I would like to maybe add

355
00:40:45.408 --> 00:40:47.050
112S-001: and this would be like

356
00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:58.300
112S-001: this. We couldn't add a question about this exactly, but I would like to add, like a computational aspect to the questions. And I sort of just wanted to throw that idea out there.

357
00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:12.669
112S-001: So like, when you're doing a cross product and adopt and adopt product. Normally, we just write it out by hand. But computers are becoming a bigger part of math, and I would like to see that.

358
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.990
112S-001: like in math education.

359
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.430
112R-003: One of the things to the context for that to keep in mind

360
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.709
112R-003: is that we're going to be

361
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.629
112R-003: kind of doing things incrementally

362
00:41:32.661 --> 00:41:46.149
112R-003: where we we are going to try to focus on things that are a little bit more short answer in the in the 1st wave. But we'll we're going to be including more and more formats of questions as the project progresses.

363
00:41:46.875 --> 00:42:00.479
112R-003: So because because I think almost everyone in part as part of the project is also very interested in actually affecting computation. The tools we use to affect computation. So

364
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.940
112R-003: so I'm noticing

365
00:42:20.653 --> 00:42:25.489
112R-003: there's a span is showing up in a couple of places

366
00:42:36.858 --> 00:42:44.810
112R-003: linear independence is showing up in a couple of places. David, are those? Can you remind me in the textbook.

367
00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:49.699
112R-003: How those how span and linear independence are kind of organized.

368
00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.059
112A-005: Yeah, those sections.

369
00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.199
112A-005: So the section on span is section 2.3,

370
00:42:56.430 --> 00:43:02.340
112A-005: and the section on linear independence is section 2.4. So they're adjacent sections

371
00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:03.690
112A-005: to one another.

372
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:20.010
112R-003: So one of the things to keep in mind. One of the constraints that we're operating within is that when we conduct this, so the the part that you didn't see. The sample cognitive interview is that we actually gave a specific

373
00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:30.650
112R-003: little excerpt of reading from one specific section of the active calculus textbook. And then, in response to that one location of reading, they were given some questions.

374
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:31.755
112R-003: So

375
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:43.520
112R-003: one of the things to be sensitive to, and the questions you develop is at the point of the reading. What knowledge can you assume? The student has to work with at and up to that point in the reading.

376
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:49.270
112A-005: So, you know, when I think about this question.

377
00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:57.490
112A-005: I can't help sort of thinking about a bigger picture like, would it be important to choose 3 topics that are kind of spaced

378
00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:01.320
112A-005: throughout the semester? Or is there a problem if they're kind of

379
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:05.460
112A-005: all in a matter of like a couple of weeks, or how do we? Wanna

380
00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.910
112A-005: how do we want to think about that? I mean, independent of the

381
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:10.700
112A-005: mathematical content.

382
00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:15.219
112R-003: And it's a great question for the whole group.

383
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:42.179
112T-007: I I mean. I noticed this last time when we did this, that I thought was kind of interesting was that you know the way the groups were sort of split up with the students together, and then the faculty in their own groups that the faculty kind of focused on span and linearly linear independence, and the students focused on the Eigenvalues and I

384
00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:49.969
112T-007: and I thought that was interesting, that and I would suspect some of that is, those of us who have taught this material

385
00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.379
112T-007: recognize that the

386
00:44:53.510 --> 00:45:12.729
112T-007: topics that our students seem to understand the least are span and linear independence, which is probably why we sort of thought to go there. They're fundamental but theoretical. And then the students right? The topics that they see in other classes and things like that tend to be the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. So kind of the the importance of that tool

387
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:42.359
112T-007: across a math curriculum probably stands out to. I don't know I'm guessing for the students a little bit, but I I thought it was kind of interesting, so I might suggest that we do at least one of the kind of more theoretical topics that I always find challenging to get my students to understand. And then maybe one of the topics that the students feel is really like kind of fundamental. So like something faculty, think of as fundamental something that students think of as fundamental, even though these aren't. I mean, I would agree. They're all fundamental.

388
00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:54.049
112R-003: And actually, so, Jennifer, actually, I'll give you like, this is total sneak, peek, insider knowledge. Everybody. Okay. You didn't hear it from me.

389
00:45:54.110 --> 00:46:01.725
112R-003: But in the other linear algebra star team, Eigenvalues Eigenvectors came up actually from

390
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:06.459
112R-003: from the kind of textbook author.

391
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:23.169
112R-003: because that insight that you just had because they were thinking about results that students depend on in later applications for exactly what you pointed out. And so it showed it showed up in a different place, not from the students. It actually showed up from a different place for similar to that reason. So that's really fascinating.

392
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.079
112R-003: But you didn't hear it from me.

393
00:46:29.079 --> 00:46:35.809
112S-002: I do have a question kind of a side topic. Are we allowed to say name so like if I am, I allowed to say, like Jennifer.

394
00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:40.879
112R-003: Yeah, do not. Yeah with yes, because we will. That that's fine. Yes.

395
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.560
112S-002: Okay, perfect, perfect. So

396
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:48.380
112S-002: that's quite interesting that you said that, Jennifer, because me

397
00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:52.279
112S-002: and Joshua, you can by all means like intervene and

398
00:46:53.330 --> 00:47:00.200
112S-002: add what you need to say. But when we were in our little meeting that our little zoom room thing.

399
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:28.290
112S-002: that is one of the things we talked about that it is one thing that reoccurs in other subjects, and also we picked Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors because it was kind of in the middle of the textbook. So it kind of aligns with what David said, like picking something from different parts of the textbook, and we picked something from the middle. So then we could gauge what we needed to know what was needed from the beginning, and also how we could continue so. It was kind of

400
00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.249
112S-002: the best of both worlds of both of what y'all said. So.

401
00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:48.560
112T-008: And I'd just like to say that I really like and support. We didn't put it on our list, but I like the idea of having Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues as one of the topics

402
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:52.876
112T-008: for the reasons that have been discussed. And I think there's some really nice

403
00:47:53.310 --> 00:48:10.090
112T-008: conceptual students jump to the computational. But I think these are really nice conceptual understandings of what Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues are doing, that I think I like to kind of highlight with students. And so I think that would be a really good, really good place to focus. And it kind of gets away from that sort of chapter. 2

404
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:13.040
112T-008: nexus of things. We we looked at.

405
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:22.230
112R-003: Where does it? What what section do Eigenvalues? Eigenvectors show up in.

406
00:48:23.192 --> 00:48:24.640
112A-005: They're in Chapter 4.

407
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.370
112A-005: So you know, chapters

408
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:28.640
112A-005: or sections

409
00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.570
112A-005: 4.1 4.2 and 4.3.

410
00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:37.490
112A-005: So I guess I guess I'd say I really appreciate that all the comments

411
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.660
112A-005: that I've heard so far, and I'm in agreement

412
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:46.599
112A-005: with with all of them. And one of the things I love about the subject is everything's connected.

413
00:48:47.675 --> 00:48:55.519
112A-005: So I mean, I could imagine a question about Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors that also relates to linear independence

414
00:48:55.650 --> 00:49:00.749
112A-005: in in a way, too. So so I think, you know, in some sense it's not an either.

415
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:14.959
112A-005: or but it's a yes, and kind of kind of thing, but I think I think having something about Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors would be a great idea, and especially just in my own experience with students. It's such a. It seems like such a weird concept

416
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:21.189
112A-005: when you when you 1st see it, and then you start digging into it. It's like, Wow, this is really amazing.

417
00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:25.329
112A-005: So I think I think there's a lot of potential there. So I would, I would very much support.

418
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.550
112A-005: You know, this being a topic.

419
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:48.920
112R-003: I'm just kind of like, also bouncing back to see if there's others that we haven't reflected on.

420
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:54.350
112R-003: So invertibility shows up

421
00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.629
112R-003: in both of those other 2 groups.

422
00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.780
112T-008: Is that in chapter 3, David.

423
00:50:04.502 --> 00:50:05.440
112A-005: Yes, it is.

424
00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:26.419
112T-008: I did have one minor concern, a topic that's near and dear to my heart. But I worry about including it would be the orthogonality dot products

425
00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:27.946
112T-008: cross products.

426
00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:36.480
112T-008: I don't believe cross Products appears in David's book, at least not directly. And I think

427
00:50:36.828 --> 00:50:42.239
112T-008: dot products doesn't come up with orthogonality until till Chapter 6. I think it's going to be.

428
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:48.869
112T-008: Not all courses are going to get there, at least substantially during the semester, and so that that would be my only concern. I really like

429
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:57.287
112T-008: it as a topic, but I'm not sure it. It kind of fits going linearly through the book in a semester for some of the courses.

430
00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:02.049
112T-008: we can. We can discuss that because I think I usually get there at least

431
00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:07.100
112T-008: significantly, through chapter 6. But I think maybe some of the courses we were saying didn't.

432
00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:16.440
112T-007: Yeah, I I agree with that. And I think you know, obviously, we're picking starting places, not ending places. So

433
00:51:16.992 --> 00:51:24.500
112T-007: I think we can certainly get, maybe in the long run to some of these other things. So like I guess I would advocate

434
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:36.809
112T-007: for doing like sort of the Eigenvalue Eigenvector stuff, and then maybe say linear independence, because part of me feels like if we can learn if we can figure out how to write good linear independence questions.

435
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:38.150
112T-007: Then I think

436
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:43.559
112T-007: kind of there's a that will lead to ways to write good span questions.

437
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:50.190
112T-007: or that would lead to how to write good pivot questions or invertibility questions like, because those things are related. I think

438
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:52.910
112T-007: if, as a starting point.

439
00:51:53.860 --> 00:52:06.079
112T-007: and I would, I would suggest that either span or linear independence. I kind of like linear independence better. But but I think if we do one of those that will give us some insight into how to do the other.

440
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:27.099
112R-003: Does anyone anyone want to try to take a shot at articulating

441
00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:35.699
112R-003: like, if you could put in your perspective, what does this group seem to be leaning towards settling on for our topics. What does it feel like

442
00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:37.019
112R-003: from your perspective?

443
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.069
112A-005: Well, I guess I would say the the

444
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:59.590
112A-005: 2 topics

445
00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:04.900
112A-005: that I've heard suggest that our Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in linear

446
00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.130
112A-005: independence

447
00:53:07.239 --> 00:53:11.569
112A-005: if others. If others disagree. Th, then, yeah, I'd like like to hear that.

448
00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:20.984
112T-008: You know I like those 2, and and heard both you, David and and Jennifer

449
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:31.532
112T-008: supporting those I I think, with a 3rd topic. I I like the idea of invertibility. I also like an idea we haven't really discussed very much which was

450
00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:39.960
112T-008: locations of pivots and solutions, which I think is early in the course and and fundamental to understanding lots of stuff that goes on later. So I I could

451
00:53:40.302 --> 00:53:48.490
112T-008: that would be something from chapter one, whereas invertibility. Chapter 3, I. I could go either way on that, and would like to hear what people

452
00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:51.930
112T-008: think about those, or or if you have other ideas as well.

453
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.939
112T-007: I agree. I like the pivot

454
00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:09.510
112T-007: stuff. And I and I also having taught linear algebra out of a lot of different textbook. Well, not a lot of out of some other textbooks before really enjoying this 1. 1 of my favorite things about

455
00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:15.519
112T-007: David's book has been the way it frames things around pivots.

456
00:54:16.168 --> 00:54:18.439
112T-007: Because I feel like that's a

457
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:24.109
112T-007: that has been a much better framing for me to be able to explain other concepts later. So I really.

458
00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:25.400
112T-007: I think it's

459
00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:31.829
112T-007: not unique to David's, but it is still kind of special about David's compared to what else is out there.

460
00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.230
112R-003: So how do we

461
00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:52.980
112R-003: feel about this? And so before, before I ask us, how do we feel about this? Let me actually make one prefacing remark.

462
00:54:53.683 --> 00:54:55.750
112R-003: that we're very cognizant of

463
00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:58.350
112R-003: is that with different topics.

464
00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.619
112R-003: different members of

465
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:01.750
112R-003: the group

466
00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:26.610
112R-003: are coming in with different levels of experience and comfort. And even they're they're good there. There are going to be times where the group grapples with a topic that's totally outside somebody's bubble, right? Which is perfectly fine, and in fact, necessary, because in those we're not, we're not all here to be like the ultimate master. Whatever right we are here to provide

467
00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:46.399
112R-003: differing reactions to what's being proposed. And if if we're all at the same exact level of experience and comfort, there's no differences right? And so the differences in our comfort levels are important and part of the process. And so with that in mind, we're not basing this decision on

468
00:55:46.470 --> 00:56:01.659
112R-003: what are the things that most encompass your expertise. It's about what are the things that you think are that you are curious about that you are most curious about. For our 1st wave of how students will grapple with them when answering the question in that way.

469
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:05.610
112R-003: how do we feel about having eigenvalues, Eigenvectors?

470
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:11.669
112R-003: Linear independence, which I'm not coupling with span. I'm just. I have linear independence jotted down

471
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:13.580
112R-003: and pivots.

472
00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.770
112R-003: So Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors.

473
00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:17.510
112R-003: linear independence

474
00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:19.030
112R-003: pivots.

475
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:21.170
112R-003: and the relationships to solutions.

476
00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:24.860
112R-003: How do we feel about that informal pull. Wise.

477
00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:36.350
112R-003: We're doing that. We're doing the thumbs up. Poll. Okay.

478
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:40.020
112R-003: that looks like convergence to me. Okay.

479
00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:45.590
112R-003: that you could put you could put that in the notes, then, David, so this, these are our

480
00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:52.120
112R-003: or Eigenvalues Eigenvectors, linear independence pivot. And then the other thing to consider is that

481
00:56:53.186 --> 00:57:00.260
112R-003: cause. One of the things that Darren brought up really important is that like in in the textbook presentation.

482
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:09.910
112R-003: there's a certain order. There's a certain dependence of topics right there. But consider that in the context of a cognitive interview the student will only be

483
00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:25.210
112R-003: ask to read. This is our design. If if this changes, I'll let you know. Based on my current understanding, the design is that they would only read, for example, an excerpt from the Eigenvalue Eigenvector section, and they would only answer a cluster of questions from that section.

484
00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:35.899
112R-003: So we don't have to architect a flow of questions that draws upon all 3 topics together, right? These can exist independently from each other, which takes some of the pressure off of our design as well.

485
00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:36.810
112R-003: So

486
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.750
112R-003: okay.

487
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.889
112R-003: with that kind of as established as a transitional point. Is anybody in favor of just kind of like

488
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:52.130
112R-003: taking about a 3 to 5 min

489
00:57:52.610 --> 00:58:08.400
112R-003: break, leg, stretch anything? Does anybody need a break. Would this be a good time for that? Let's do that. Let's take a break. That was one of my notes to self last time, just really quickly, and then we come back. Let's go ahead and crack open the textbook and see if we can narrow this down a little bit. Then within those topics great.

490
01:01:54.890 --> 01:02:08.130
112S-002: Ms Jo, thank you so much for letting us have a little break. I get very antsy. I don't like movie theaters or movies, because sitting for a long period of time gets me

491
01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:12.709
112S-002: super Antsy. So just like moving great, awesome.

492
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.220
112R-003: Yeah.

493
01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.089
112A-005: I think we should have a dance break.

494
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:19.700
112S-002: That's always fun.

495
01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.420
112A-005: You could lead at Cisa.

496
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:31.830
112R-003: Get my get my cardio in during my star team meeting.

497
01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.560
112A-005: Absolutely.

498
01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:49.750
112S-002: People. Sometimes people sometimes think that like when I start moving a lot, it's because I'm bored or I'm tired, or it's it's just I just need to move hence. Why I dance because I'm just moving all the time. Nonstop.

499
01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:53.440
112R-003: Yeah, many people do.

500
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.319
112R-003: I? Just recently, I'm I'm sitting in my my

501
01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:06.640
112R-003: costco rolly chair right now. But I have another space that is available to me that has a standing desk.

502
01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:21.760
112R-003: And so sometimes, when I'm just like, I just can't take it anymore, I can go work at the standing desk. I didn't understand them for a long time, but I have a new understanding and appreciation for the notion of the standing desk.

503
01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.150
112R-003: So

504
01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:32.500
112R-003: okay, I was just what was I gonna look for? I was just gonna look for

505
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:35.480
112R-003: a link to

506
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.560
112R-003: the textbook.

507
01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.560
112R-003: I was actually gonna ask slash. Suggest

508
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:47.339
112R-003: Isa or Joshua, if one of you might be willing

509
01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:51.710
112R-003: to. Actually, we could help you do this if you don't have the link at your fingertips.

510
01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.610
112A-005: But I just put a link in the chat.

511
01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:55.810
112R-003: To the textbook.

512
01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:02.390
112A-005: Yeah, it doesn't. It doesn't look like it's an active link. So maybe I'll send it again. There you go.

513
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:07.140
112R-003: But yeah, if one of you either.

514
01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:07.740
112A-005: I would be willing.

515
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:08.340
112R-003: To

516
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.230
112R-003: go ahead. Go ahead, David!

517
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:14.899
112A-005: Oh, I'm I'm sorry. That's not the Runestone version, but I I guess at this point. It's not

518
01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:15.819
112A-005: too important.

519
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.900
112R-003: Oh.

520
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:23.439
112R-003: it no, it probably it isn't at this point. Because if if we're not actually planning on

521
01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:35.799
112R-003: entering in any content which we could. We can switch over to that if we decide, we want to experimentally enter in some content. Okay, but if you would be willing to just like, open up the link to the textbook and share your screen.

522
01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:39.540
112R-003: and then that'll kinda

523
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.280
112R-003: be a centerpiece for our

524
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.550
112R-003: conversation here.

525
01:05:02.476 --> 01:05:04.529
112A-005: I'm sorry. Who was it that you asked to do that?

526
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:08.570
112R-003: I was asking either Joshua or Isa if one of them would be willing to.

527
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:14.329
112R-003: You can do rock paper scissors if you need to.

528
01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:26.040
112R-003: Awesome. Thank you.

529
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:47.579
112R-003: So it's I'm kind of. This is my 1st time seeing. So that so, David, this is not in this is not on Runestone right now.

530
01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:49.350
112A-005: Right.

531
01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.849
112R-003: But it I'm

532
01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:56.339
112R-003: but the like. The layout of the actual textbook content is virtually

533
01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:57.610
112R-003: the same.

534
01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:58.650
112A-005: Yeah.

535
01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:02.239
112R-003: It just doesn't have any of those like runestone functionalities or anything like that. But it's.

536
01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.990
112A-005: That's exactly it. Yeah.

537
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:05.090
112R-003: Perfect. Okay.

538
01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:16.560
112R-003: get bigger.

539
01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.439
112R-003: Alright. Since we have, we have the

540
01:06:26.570 --> 01:06:28.940
112R-003: Chapter 4 open and displayed

541
01:06:29.287 --> 01:06:37.259
112R-003: right now. And so I'm just, gonna I'm gonna really try not to be in the driver's seat at this time for that. I just want people to kind of like

542
01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:42.859
112R-003: jump in where where you see a portion. So I think things to be thinking about.

543
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:48.760
112R-003: since our what our our goal is to ultimately get toward crafting

544
01:06:48.940 --> 01:07:10.690
112R-003: about, you know, hopefully 3 hopefully, at least one reading question per topic that we've decided about right. So our objective is, can we come up with one either adapted or completely novel reading question for eigenvalue vectors, and then one for the others and one for the others. That's our kind of a soft objective right now.

545
01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:14.490
112R-003: So thinking about both.

546
01:07:15.368 --> 01:07:18.660
112R-003: Thinking about both. What portion

547
01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:32.070
112R-003: of the section? If there's a portion like, if it's a long, would it be clipped? What is the reading portion you would want the student to see. And then, in the context of seeing that, what question would you want the student to answer?

548
01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.659
112R-003: Kind of those together?

549
01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.721
112A-005: I guess, as someone who has a little bit of experience with this book.

550
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:46.370
112A-005: I probably suggest we look in either section 4.1, which is kind of an intuitive.

551
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.819
112A-005: You know more more about this topic from an intuitive point of view, or section 4.2, which is.

552
01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.659
112A-005: you know, starting to get more.

553
01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.540
112A-005: you know. Think of it more conceptually

554
01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.550
112A-005: and also computationally.

555
01:08:58.439 --> 01:09:04.939
112R-003: So that I just something that's catching my eye. That you're scrolling past right now is in activity 4.1

556
01:09:04.999 --> 01:09:06.169
112R-003: point 2

557
01:09:06.644 --> 01:09:11.969
112R-003: part a there. So we have the definition as an important geometric interpret geometric interpretation.

558
01:09:12.329 --> 01:09:18.819
112R-003: Right? That we'll investigate here. A suppose V is a non-zero vector and that lambda is a scalar.

559
01:09:18.889 --> 01:09:27.669
112R-003: What is the geometric relationship between? So that's that's a great idea. That's a rather great example of a nice, open-ended question

560
01:09:27.859 --> 01:09:28.794
112R-003: that

561
01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:35.489
112R-003: could be adapted in some way or something along those same lines could be created in this section.

562
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:14.760
112S-001: So part

563
01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:16.970
112S-001: the

564
01:10:17.230 --> 01:10:37.960
112S-001: is asking us to verify that the Eigenvector condition holds, which I bring up because I always like verify questions. Specifically, because in a lot of like later math classes, we're asked to do proofs. But it's never really stated explicitly, in sort of the earlier math classes that you take

565
01:10:38.269 --> 01:10:47.350
112S-001: but it's like looking back at some of my older notes. It's the verify questions that at least to me seem the most like groups. So I think that might be a good reading question.

566
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:09.060
112R-003: So actually, while while you're on that thought, if everybody doesn't mind Joshua, could you? Or in any Joshua and everyone so, looking at that as an example.

567
01:11:09.637 --> 01:11:15.200
112R-003: Is there anything about the way that's currently stated that you might use as a springboard

568
01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:18.090
112R-003: to expand or change? What's being asked? There.

569
01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:29.519
112T-008: What I tend to do once the students have encountered this material for the 1st time before we do any.

570
01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:37.709
112T-008: Here's how you find the eigenvalues of a given matrix. Something like that is a question like this. But it's more of a

571
01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:45.949
112T-008: multiple. It's kind of multiple part. Here's a here's a matrix. Here's some some given vectors

572
01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:56.700
112T-008: is is each one of these an Eigenvector or not? And and why, that's the kind of it's getting at the same thing where they have to rather than do some big computation. They just compute a times, the vector

573
01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:13.769
112T-008: does it line up with the the same direction or not, and and so, but I give them some of which are Eigenvectors, some of which are not Eigenvectors, and they have to sort of sort out which ones are are, which I don't know if that's an improvement. But that's the way I've approached it, as far as in class exercises.

574
01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:28.310
112R-003: You know what I'm gonna I'm gonna propose at this time that I'm gonna start up a blank document in our star team folder so that as we kind of like hash out these proto questions here, we can actually just start writing them, and everyone can see them

575
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:30.520
112R-003: and adapt them.

576
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:32.759
112R-003: Let me do that right now.

577
01:12:33.381 --> 01:12:35.140
112A-005: I've been doing that in the notes.

578
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.010
112A-005: Oh, let's see.

579
01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:37.539
112R-003: Yeah, let me.

580
01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:38.280
112A-005: Confusing.

581
01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:42.319
112R-003: And it should. Yeah, it's something that should exist additionally.

582
01:12:43.634 --> 01:12:47.749
112R-003: So maybe I'll just capture what you did, and I'll just grab those over.

583
01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:59.169
112R-003: Because, like, for example, what Darren just said, the actual

584
01:12:59.748 --> 01:13:04.970
112R-003: just the actual question, the way you posed it is something I'd like to capture.

585
01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.050
112A-005: Sure.

586
01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.799
112R-003: I'm gonna temporarily

587
01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:24.179
112R-003: all of this

588
01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:27.989
112R-003: developed questions and naming can be

589
01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:30.180
112R-003: interrogated later.

590
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:44.589
112R-003: So here's a i'll just share a link to this. Everyone can edit this and add to this. So rather than you having me trying to transcribe what you're saying.

591
01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.509
112R-003: So there is just a blank document

592
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:02.760
112R-003: and doesn't have to be beautiful.

593
01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:10.330
112R-003: but just to capture the ones you're thinking of. And one of the things that would be helpful is

594
01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:21.390
112R-003: if the actual section number that you're feeling that that's appropriate with it, that that it corresponds to in the textbook. Notate that somehow, in the question you're writing.

595
01:14:22.650 --> 01:14:25.470
112R-003: So which section actual section number

596
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.580
112R-003: are we in now?

597
01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.770
112R-003: 4.1 still 4.1. Okay?

598
01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:32.449
112R-003: 4 point. So.

599
01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:44.999
112R-003: yeah. And if there's something in, I guess. For example, if the the question that's similar that you're thinking about is similar to what's going on in 4.1 point 2. Make a little note about that.

600
01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:53.460
112T-008: I really like to to give questions that some of the ideas that are here in 4 1.2

601
01:15:54.438 --> 01:16:07.721
112T-008: section 4, 1.2. I I like to give questions that really get at this usefulness early on as well, because I really like the way it's kind of front and center in in David's coverage here. But like this.

602
01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:12.643
112T-008: for instance, question with the with the graph that's showing right now.

603
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:19.150
112T-008: I like these questions where they know something about how a acts on v. 1 and v. 2. And they have to

604
01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:24.129
112T-008: say how a acts on a certain linear combination of v 1 and v, 2, because

605
01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:36.049
112T-008: later on they have to do that, but much more elaborately, with higher powers of A and things like that. And so so I don't know if there's a question we could fashion in that way. But I really like the getting the the concept

606
01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:38.870
112T-008: out there.

607
01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:42.760
112R-003: And these visuals

608
01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:51.529
112R-003: or something that are going to be available. So the the whole textbook will be available to the student at the time of the interview that will actually be in the textbook.

609
01:16:51.560 --> 01:17:07.989
112R-003: and they will be able to if they want to. They're like, Oh, hey! I think I want to answer your question, but I want to actually jump up here to this other chapter and check this definition. They are totally free to do that at the time of the interview, so they'll be able to interact with any of the contents available content that's available to them

610
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:13.890
112R-003: in or out of the textbook, for that matter, if they want to jump over to Google and Google something fine.

611
01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:04.990
112S-001: So. This appeared earlier, but it sort of relates to like flipping

612
01:18:06.450 --> 01:18:09.149
112S-001: flipping how a graph is oriented.

613
01:18:09.330 --> 01:18:13.160
112S-001: I'm not sure if I've seen a question like this before, but I'd like

614
01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:16.429
112S-001: a question, or I'd like to have seen a question that like

615
01:18:16.690 --> 01:18:18.000
112S-001: asks.

616
01:18:18.010 --> 01:18:21.189
112S-001: here is a quadratic equation.

617
01:18:21.691 --> 01:18:27.450
112S-001: Use eigenvalues and eigenvectors to like flip this by 45 degrees, or something.

618
01:18:28.179 --> 01:18:34.729
112S-001: So like just another geometry question, but working more with like two-dimensional and 3 dimensional graphs.

619
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:50.389
112A-005: I'm I'm so I I would just like to make sure that I really understand what

620
01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:54.320
112A-005: what you said, Joshua. Could. Could you kind of repeat that, and

621
01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.930
112A-005: maybe flesh it out.

622
01:18:56.150 --> 01:18:56.490
112S-001: Yeah.

623
01:18:56.490 --> 01:18:57.160
112A-005: Bit more.

624
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.995
112S-001: So

625
01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:01.240
112S-001: like. Part of what this

626
01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:07.060
112S-001: is covering is sort of geometrically shifting a grass orientation.

627
01:19:07.604 --> 01:19:17.640
112S-001: And I remember explicitly covering that like in a geometry class. So what would happen if you turn like a parabola by 45 degrees, and how would it look?

628
01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:21.289
112S-001: And then we would get questions about if it's still a function or not.

629
01:19:21.685 --> 01:19:31.919
112S-001: But I at least I don't remember it being covered, for like more complex, 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional graphs so like if I got the saddle shape.

630
01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:41.760
112S-001: and I wanted to reorient that shape by some amount of degrees in 3 dimensions, like, I would. I would like to see sort of like a question like that.

631
01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.480
112S-001: or

632
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:58.759
112S-001: like I forget. It's called like a hyperboloid. 2 sheet or something like that where you can shift it, but it's access would be shifted somehow. I think, like I think it would just be cool to use linear algebra and connect it to

633
01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:00.450
112S-001: like Calgary or something.

634
01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:08.900
112R-003: Kind of apply an operator for the orientation of the whole space.

635
01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.309
112R-003: That's really, yeah, that's really interesting.

636
01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.609
112R-003: I think that I also am really interested in

637
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:32.489
112R-003: people's ability to visualize spatial effects. Things.

638
01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:41.629
112R-003: I was. And the comment that you sent to me, Joshua, earlier, I think it was you had emailed it to me.

639
01:20:41.650 --> 01:20:44.660
112R-003: or I don't know if we talked about in the meeting, or if you emailed it to me.

640
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:48.580
112R-003: but about like being able to

641
01:20:48.930 --> 01:20:50.610
112R-003: actually visualize

642
01:20:51.212 --> 01:20:55.730
112R-003: things. And I was recently reviewing a paper where somebody was really concerned in

643
01:20:55.890 --> 01:21:00.879
112R-003: electrical engineering, with people being able to understand electrical fields. And so they were actually

644
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:05.230
112R-003: working on an AR

645
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:15.280
112R-003: tool that the person could actually see and kind of like be in the 3D space of the field and understand the shape of the field. And so

646
01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:22.759
112R-003: it's like, well, and I think yours was about actually understanding just kind of like the 3D graphical

647
01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:24.460
112R-003: things

648
01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:25.730
112R-003: so

649
01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:28.050
112R-003: kind of like right along that same interest set.

650
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:47.879
112R-003: do we? Do? We want to

651
01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:53.404
112R-003: take a little bit of a delve into each of the 3 sections to

652
01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:57.470
112R-003: We've looked at the the Eigenvalue Eigenvector.

653
01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:08.950
112R-003: Section 4.1. Here for a little bit. Do we want to look at more of that. However, we want to to do. This is fine. Do we want to take a foray through linear independence?

654
01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:15.019
112R-003: To see if there's something in there that kind of jumps out that people want to try imagining questions for.

655
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:17.310
112R-003: which is in

656
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:19.940
112R-003: 2.4. Yes.

657
01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:22.450
112A-005: Yeah, sure I'd be. I'd be fine with that.

658
01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:02.660
112R-003: And this one brings us right back to what Darren was saying in 2 2. It's

659
01:24:02.690 --> 01:24:05.460
112R-003: yeah, 2.4 to point 2

660
01:24:09.958 --> 01:24:12.399
112R-003: down in question. C there.

661
01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:19.430
112R-003: and looking at the pivot positions, how can you determine whether columns of matrix are linear, dependent or independent? There's a connect nice connection.

662
01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:53.039
112T-007: Yes, for linear dependence and independence.

663
01:24:53.500 --> 01:25:04.539
112T-007: I don't know exactly what the question would look like, but I would if we're thinking about it as a reading question like, what would I want a student to be able to do after sort of reading the text and maybe working through

664
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:09.451
112T-007: like the preview activity or whatever. I I think.

665
01:25:10.090 --> 01:25:11.850
112T-007: ability to kind of

666
01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:17.950
112T-007: understand the definition. So some kind of question that asks them.

667
01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:27.980
112T-007: you know, either by an example of trying to, you know, like giving an example of.

668
01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:45.299
112T-007: you know, some vectors that are linearly independent or dependent, or something like that, but to something that actually make makes them go back to the definition and check whether the definition applies, and try and understand that, or putting the definition in their own words that kind of thing.

669
01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.320
112T-007: because it's it's okay to get to pivots and things like that eventually, but

670
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:59.460
112T-007: without understanding what the definition is, it just becomes a rule that doesn't transfer somewhere else.

671
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:09.819
112S-001: I really like that idea, too. And when, like a question of coming up with your own system.

672
01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.089
112S-001: or like linearly dependent system.

673
01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.179
112S-001: I think would be a really good question.

674
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:23.660
112A-005: So what if we had a question, maybe where we gave them 2 vectors, 2 linearly independent vectors

675
01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:27.699
112A-005: and said and said something like, add a 3rd vector

676
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:30.420
112A-005: so that the set is linearly dependent.

677
01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.170
112T-008: I really like that question, David. I've

678
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:37.090
112T-008: I've asked it

679
01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:45.729
112T-008: both ways in succession. Give a 3rd vector. That makes it linearly dependent and then give a 3rd vector that makes it linearly independent.

680
01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.200
112T-008: and

681
01:26:48.610 --> 01:26:55.668
112T-008: it's interesting the different way students approach that because once they know the sort of pivot

682
01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:01.430
112T-008: sort of algorithms for doing things. They they may launch into some

683
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:11.780
112T-008: sort of convoluted process without realizing they can well, just add the 2 vectors together. Here's a dependent vector for the, you know, to fill out the set or something like that. So I, yeah, I think that

684
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:14.110
112T-008: says a lot about how they think about

685
01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:16.940
112T-008: dependence and independence.

686
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:25.200
112T-008: Jennifer, I also like go ahead. Sorry.

687
01:27:25.770 --> 01:27:34.240
112R-003: I was just gonna ask Jennifer for you to kind of follow up on like with those suggestions. How are you feel? How does that resonate with you as far as the goal of drawing on the definition.

688
01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:37.310
112T-007: Yeah, and yeah, I think.

689
01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:43.370
112T-007: I think.

690
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:52.887
112T-007: well, I think I'd want to think about it a little more. I mean, I definitely like that idea. I think that's a i think the given example is a useful way to get at A at a

691
01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:55.000
112T-007: The students understanding.

692
01:27:57.850 --> 01:28:09.200
112T-007: I'm I'm also thinking back to Joshua's comment about sort of the verify thing where they have to rely on the definition. And so maybe those are a couple of different ways to approach it, too, like.

693
01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:13.180
112T-007: you know, using the definition to verify something

694
01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:16.000
112T-007: as well as give an example of.

695
01:28:38.490 --> 01:28:41.999
112R-003: And then somebody was gonna say something, and I cut them off, and I don't remember who it was.

696
01:28:42.261 --> 01:28:48.790
112T-008: That was me I was just going to go back to. I think we went past it. Activity 2.4 point 2, which is

697
01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:51.074
112T-008: oh, right there, where you where you are, I guess.

698
01:28:55.470 --> 01:29:00.362
112T-008: A a question that maybe connects the ideas as Jennifer saying that

699
01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.600
112T-008: says something like

700
01:29:04.116 --> 01:29:12.120
112T-008: show that W. 3 is a linear combination of w. 1 and W. 2, kind of like part B here, and then asking the follow up question.

701
01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:19.299
112T-008: are these vectors linearly dependent or linearly independent? And why? To just connect that definition with

702
01:29:19.330 --> 01:29:24.630
112T-008: the concepts of dependent and independent? Because I sometimes I, you know, students can show that W.

703
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:34.040
112T-008: Combination of w. 1 of W. 2. But they don't get the relationship to dependence then. And I I don't know. I like. The way that Part B is is kind of getting at that.

704
01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:59.930
112R-003: So kind of a 2 parter Darren. So then demonstrate the linear combination. But then actually, explicitly, okay, are these linear, independent or linear.

705
01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:04.110
112T-008: And whether you make them dependent or independent. Yeah, I think the ones in B there are independent. But

706
01:30:10.450 --> 01:30:11.140
112R-003: Yeah.

707
01:30:14.825 --> 01:30:23.039
112T-007: I'm just thinking about cause I I know I know my students in this material, right? They want to jump to the matrix and row reduce.

708
01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:27.200
112T-007: And if we're really trying to think about the definition.

709
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:29.240
112T-007: you know, maybe

710
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:34.059
112T-007: giving them a more abstract.

711
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:36.590
112T-007: you know linear combination

712
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:39.009
112T-007: that then, like.

713
01:30:40.730 --> 01:30:46.069
112T-007: I don't know. I really have to think about it, but thinking about, you know.

714
01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:49.539
112T-007: giving them a linear combination.

715
01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.130
112T-007: And.

716
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:55.219
112T-007: you know, asking them to sort of

717
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:59.900
112T-007: verify that one of those vectors is a linear combination, you know, like giving.

718
01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:02.340
112T-007: you know, giving this a

719
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:03.670
112T-007: the

720
01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:18.480
112T-007: right, like a linear combination equaling 0. And then explain why one of these vectors is a linear combination of the other vectors, or something like where they have to kind of do the little. The sort of play around with those equations

721
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:24.509
112T-007: a little bit to really understand writing one vector as a linear combination of the other vectors.

722
01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:31.150
112T-007: Given some kind of algebraic expression of the vectors.

723
01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:42.750
112S-002: Ms. Jennifer, I really like where you're where you were going with that, because that's

724
01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:48.349
112S-002: how it made sense to me doing some having a problem where I had to manipulate and

725
01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:51.410
112S-002: similar to what you were saying. I

726
01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:53.900
112S-002: I really like that type of question.

727
01:32:32.610 --> 01:32:35.849
112R-003: Unless there's other things that are immediately jumping out.

728
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:43.700
112R-003: about the linear independent section. Do we want to take a little stroll through

729
01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:45.710
112R-003: invertibility.

730
01:32:51.207 --> 01:32:54.149
112A-005: So I think the 3rd topic we had was about pivots.

731
01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.110
112R-003: Oh, not invertebrates.

732
01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:58.779
112A-005: So that would be section like 1 point.

733
01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:02.609
112R-003: That's a different part of my napkins scritching here. Pivot.

734
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:27.210
112T-007: So with with pivots. I really like the idea of checking

735
01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:36.819
112T-007: like sort of giving examples of a matrix and

736
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:50.659
112T-007: kind of is, they're kind of related to sort of true false questions, or something, but like where they're not necessarily all in reduced row, echelon form. But kind of you know where you can sort of see what the next step would be

737
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:53.060
112T-007: to get students to realize like you can.

738
01:33:55.070 --> 01:34:05.160
112T-007: you need, like, you kind of need the the reduced rationalon form to see where there's a pivot, just because there's a 1 in the 1st column, or, you know, a leading one doesn't make it a pivot. Yet

739
01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.559
112T-007: so kind of these.

740
01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:07.886
112T-007: you know.

741
01:34:09.630 --> 01:34:10.880
112S-002: Slightly.

742
01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:11.920
112T-007: But yeah.

743
01:34:12.150 --> 01:34:13.299
112T-007: so kind of

744
01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:16.559
112T-007: being able to decide

745
01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:21.670
112T-007: even just whether they have enough information at that stage as to whether something's a pivot.

746
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:37.582
112T-007: I yeah. I also, I also think,

747
01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:43.049
112T-007: kind of getting that getting to the difference between, like the kind of the

748
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:50.520
112T-007: the pivot as a number and the position that that's in right. A lot of times this at this stage, in this.

749
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:53.789
112T-007: in this class, trying to kind of understand

750
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:56.389
112T-007: like that, a matrix can have

751
01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:59.629
112T-007: pivot positions without you

752
01:34:59.850 --> 01:35:05.909
112T-007: having reduced it right like that, that those things are related to the original matrix, even without the row reduced

753
01:35:06.630 --> 01:35:07.720
112T-007: matrix.

754
01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:19.869
112T-007: But again I'd have to think I'd have to think a little bit more about what I'd really want that to look like.

755
01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.039
112A-005: But I think

756
01:35:27.190 --> 01:35:28.969
112A-005: you know, I think I think what Jen

757
01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:34.920
112A-005: just says is really important, because it's it's connected. That that idea seems to show up over and over again.

758
01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:38.389
112A-005: and and there's some kind of simple like

759
01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:43.289
112A-005: you can have have more. You can have more pivot positions.

760
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:45.810
112A-005: Then there are rows in the matrix

761
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:48.649
112A-005: or columns in the matrix. And that kind of thinking

762
01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.369
112A-005: is really really important.

763
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:52.760
112A-005: You know, later on.

764
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:58.150
112A-005: when you're looking at concepts like span and linear independence. So I like that idea.

765
01:36:07.410 --> 01:36:13.350
112T-007: Yeah. Actually, I think I think, David, in some of these sections you had, you have questions that are

766
01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:22.709
112T-007: about, you know the maximum number of pivots a certain matrix could have, and things like that. And I think those make good reading questions, too, like

767
01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:27.629
112T-007: to explain the maximum number of pivots. You know.

768
01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:30.610
112T-007: a certain size matrix could have.

769
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:32.999
112T-007: And you know, how do you know that

770
01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:25.879
112T-007: I think this is also a good section? For give example.

771
01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:29.440
112T-007: give an example of a matrix which has.

772
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:31.000
112T-007: you know.

773
01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:33.790
112T-007: 2 pivots.

774
01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:35.270
112T-007: but is.

775
01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:41.169
112T-007: but has a unique solution. Give an example, you know, like some of those kinds of questions.

776
01:37:41.532 --> 01:37:46.530
112T-007: Make good reading questions. I'm looking at your principle. 1.4 point 5 right? That

777
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:55.429
112R-003: If you asked it. Yeah. And so like, when you think, think of those, if you ask the question, give an example.

778
01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:57.980
112R-003: Matrix with these characteristics.

779
01:38:00.010 --> 01:38:01.830
112R-003: you wouldn't want the

780
01:38:02.590 --> 01:38:10.510
112R-003: well we can always ask. So like in the in the cognitive interview, we can ask them to provide an example of the matrix that has these characteristics, and then we can follow up with.

781
01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:17.180
112R-003: Tell us how you arrived at that. Tell us how you know that right? But we can also architect the question itself.

782
01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:18.500
112R-003: because

783
01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:23.390
112R-003: we want that we want to be able to elicit there between the lines, thinking

784
01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:28.970
112R-003: in a normal, in like an organic classroom setting. Not just when they're in the cognitive interview, when we're following up

785
01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.280
112R-003: so like when you think about those

786
01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:36.769
112R-003: what would you want to follow up with? What would you want them to

787
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:38.470
112R-003: highlight

788
01:38:38.630 --> 01:38:40.050
112R-003: in their process

789
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:42.680
112R-003: and dig for?

790
01:40:22.450 --> 01:40:25.099
112R-003: Has anybody spotted any questions?

791
01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:31.339
112R-003: In this section, or the prior ones, eigenvalues linear independence.

792
01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:40.890
112R-003: that they like the question as it is now, and they they can see just maybe minor modification to the question.

793
01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.700
112R-003: have any really grabbed your eye yet.

794
01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:53.510
112T-007: I think, in in the pivot section question 3 at the end. Right? This is a give the give an example. One that was probably what I was thinking of a little bit.

795
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:57.369
112T-007: yeah. So

796
01:40:59.690 --> 01:41:00.990
112T-007: so we can sort of

797
01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:03.329
112T-007: build on that kind of idea.

798
01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.539
112R-003: I'm gonna copy paste this as

799
01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.209
112R-003: in there, and to our inspiration list as well.

800
01:41:27.710 --> 01:41:33.350
112T-007: And and I know, having assigned that question a lot, the guarantee part is always really confusing for the students.

801
01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:39.310
112T-007: So maybe breaking this down in some way

802
01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:42.470
112T-007: about.

803
01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:48.430
112T-007: you know, kind of starting with an example that has that property, and then

804
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:50.240
112T-007: you know

805
01:41:50.530 --> 01:41:59.059
112T-007: whether there's anything they can say about uniqueness whether there's anything they can say about infinitely many solutions, and.

806
01:41:59.770 --> 01:42:04.790
112T-007: you know, get them, maybe to explain what sort of feature they're looking at in their example, to decide that

807
01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:24.180
112T-007: I mean, does my students have a hard time, with the difference between guarantee and possible.

808
01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:42.809
112R-003: That's really great.

809
01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:50.510
112T-008: This is jumping topics just a little bit, but

810
01:42:50.690 --> 01:42:54.840
112T-008: in terms of 2.4 linear independence.

811
01:42:55.286 --> 01:43:00.039
112T-008: Likewise, at the end of the section in the exercises. There are

812
01:43:00.391 --> 01:43:03.189
112T-008: like Number 3 and number 4. I really like

813
01:43:03.636 --> 01:43:13.683
112T-008: questions like that. Maybe maybe we we could think about not doing it in terms of an arbitrary number of vectors. But you know you can ask similar questions.

814
01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:19.960
112T-008: about how you know if if vectors are dependent, and if you add more vectors to the set.

815
01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:29.248
112T-008: it remains dependent. If they understand what dependent is, they would understand why that is. And that's same kind of concept with linear independence.

816
01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:34.869
112T-008: in the next question, and number 4,

817
01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:40.319
112T-008: definitely. Some things I think we could build off of there. And those kinds of questions.

818
01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:54.140
112S-002: I do like that

819
01:43:54.170 --> 01:43:55.240
112S-002: for

820
01:43:56.510 --> 01:44:06.000
112S-002: for 3 and 4, and also the previous problems we were looking at in the other chapter. I do like that. They start with A

821
01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:20.989
112S-002: BC on number 4 and A on number 3. I like how it starts with an if, then and then afterwards it takes out the if, then, where students have to figure out which part is the given and which part is not the given, I

822
01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:28.489
112S-002: I know it sometimes becomes difficult when you're so trained to look for the if, then, and then you don't have it. People tend to

823
01:44:28.630 --> 01:44:29.440
112S-002: kind of

824
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:31.370
112S-002: a little

825
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:36.939
112S-002: scared from there to determine which part. So I like how it like leads, and then it takes it out. So then

826
01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:40.220
112S-002: students are able to determine what is given, and not.

827
01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:58.910
112R-003: And anything that I'm typing into this

828
01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:05.480
112R-003: document about a question ideas that if if I don't capture it correctly, just do surgery on whatever I've typed in here

829
01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:08.579
112R-003: and overwrite anything I've put in there, or add to it at all.

830
01:45:45.330 --> 01:45:52.974
112T-008: Sorry I was having trouble getting unmuted. I think. Number 7. There you scrolled by is a really nice type of question as well,

831
01:45:56.690 --> 01:45:57.390
112T-008: but

832
01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:01.500
112T-008: just having them think about

833
01:46:01.670 --> 01:46:05.069
112T-008: whether or not such a configuration is possible. And then what the

834
01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:09.060
112T-008: our ref type of matrix would have to look like.

835
01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:18.980
112R-003: Hmm.

836
01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:22.640
112S-001: Similarly.

837
01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:35.069
112S-001: I really like Question 8. When we start to prove different things or different properties that, like sets of numbers, have, or properties that numbers have and matrices might not have.

838
01:46:35.382 --> 01:46:40.460
112S-001: Those are like anytime. I get that type of question. I get really excited because it's sort of

839
01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:47.590
112S-001: more of the theory side of math, at least in my mind. So I really do like to appreciate questions like this.

840
01:47:13.690 --> 01:47:23.679
112R-003: And to kind of round that out. Since we have some, we have some baselines that we we'd like to springboard from from pivots and linear independence.

841
01:47:24.210 --> 01:47:29.310
112R-003: is there something that jumps out in the Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors

842
01:47:31.650 --> 01:47:35.299
112R-003: as an example, baseline question or questions?

843
01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:44.180
112R-003: I think these are really useful for in between now, and when we meet again.

844
01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:48.739
112R-003: To kind of seed people's thinking.

845
01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:50.910
112R-003: be able to see these very concretely.

846
01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:04.810
112R-003: I know, Joshua, you had mentioned some that really struck you as very interesting ones.

847
01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:10.200
112S-001: The 1st ones.

848
01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:18.420
112S-001: I mean, I like these because you get to like engage with sage and it's sort of like it's moving

849
01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:25.290
112S-001: map onto like the computational side. So anytime, I see a question like this.

850
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:30.000
112S-001: I would really like it. I'm not sure how, yet, at least to develop

851
01:48:30.090 --> 01:48:32.990
112S-001: like a computer based question. But if

852
01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:39.410
112S-001: we could somehow combine this with a more like theoretical side of math, I think it would make really good.

853
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:41.829
112S-001: really good connections and really good questions.

854
01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:51.259
112S-002: When when

855
01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:59.590
112S-002: when students are able to engage, does it tell you if like, if they answer the question, does it tell you if they're right or wrong, or

856
01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:00.850
112S-002: anything.

857
01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:03.849
112S-001: Yep, and so.

858
01:49:03.850 --> 01:49:07.220
112R-003: Oh, you mean in this, in the stage. So is that what you're asking.

859
01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:07.720
112S-002: Yes.

860
01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:08.940
112R-003: Oh, okay. Okay.

861
01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:29.409
112S-001: Yes, and that's 1 of the benefits that at least I got from using it. It's sort of just like a calculator, and it can do more advanced forms of math. You just sort of have to like. Learn all of the syntax and the typing which is annoying. I'm not going to say that's annoying, but if you know it, it's sort of it acts as a calculator.

862
01:49:29.410 --> 01:49:43.920
112S-001: And so, in the same way, like people in middle and high school are able to just check their answers. You could be given like linear algebra, a linear algebra question and actually check your answer. And then you could take it to your teacher with like more

863
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.360
112S-001: in-depth questions and more like technical questions, to help with your understanding.

864
01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:51.049
112S-002: Thank you.

865
01:49:53.410 --> 01:49:53.950
112S-002: So.

866
01:49:53.950 --> 01:50:01.379
112T-007: In the in the Eigenvalue Eigenvector section. I actually really like something that's like in the preview question

867
01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:06.209
112T-007: in this section which has them do like use the linearity

868
01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:13.740
112T-007: to rewrite. So it's in one, yeah, 4.1 in the preview question. The last part.

869
01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:17.799
112T-007: There's a list of yeah, this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

870
01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:28.109
112T-007: because that I mean, that's something that they have to do over and over again to actually apply. Do any of the applications, and I,

871
01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:32.379
112T-007: my my students, could do that here.

872
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:39.190
112T-007: but then they would forget that they could do that, and then they would forget that they could do that, and then they would forget they could do that.

873
01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:49.919
112T-007: And so I think, in terms of reading questions, having them do something like that. Computation for sort of a power like, you know, kind of like number 6 A to the 4th

874
01:50:49.950 --> 01:50:51.440
112T-007: times. v. 1.

875
01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:59.840
112T-007: Just doing that kind of computation, even in a reading question to sort of remind them that they can.

876
01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.990
112T-007: You know, when they have this eigenvalue equation.

877
01:51:04.744 --> 01:51:13.770
112T-007: Is that they can rewrite these powers of a matrix. So so I, even if it's in a reading questions, just kind of computing this, and then

878
01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:20.939
112T-007: maybe sort of trying to generalize. So, could you do this for any power of a explain why you could do that.

879
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:31.389
112A-005: Yeah, I think that's a good point. Students sometimes say, well.

880
01:51:31.490 --> 01:51:34.080
112A-005: how can I do that? Because I don't know you didn't tell me what

881
01:51:34.290 --> 01:51:37.300
112A-005: the matrix and the vector are. And it's like, well, but

882
01:51:37.570 --> 01:51:40.689
112A-005: you have. You have enough information. It's just presented

883
01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:43.330
112A-005: in in a different way. And I think this

884
01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:50.870
112A-005: goes to the conversation we had when we're thinking about this section a little bit earlier, just about you know how

885
01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:56.680
112A-005: these concepts are gonna be used in the future. So yeah, I think I think this would be, you know, kind of

886
01:51:57.210 --> 01:51:58.340
112A-005: inappropriate.

887
01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.039
112A-005: you know. Place to bring that in.

888
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:09.360
112S-001: In building off of what both of you said. I wanted to bring up the point.

889
01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:15.459
112S-001: because I haven't. I don't. At least I don't think I've seen the question here, but the explain questions.

890
01:52:15.967 --> 01:52:23.489
112S-001: I think it would be good to have more writing of like actual sentences and paragraphs in math.

891
01:52:24.066 --> 01:52:30.290
112S-001: Because at least in my mind, a lot of math classes I take are super test oriented.

892
01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:34.220
112S-001: and I never get to write about anything, and I like writing.

893
01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:38.449
112S-001: So I think an explained question would sort of give me the chance to

894
01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:42.829
112S-001: like expound on a mathematical idea. More than just

895
01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:45.650
112S-001: solving a problem and writing the answer.

896
01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:48.700
112S-001: yeah.

897
01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:50.360
112T-008: Oh, okay, yeah. Go ahead.

898
01:52:50.710 --> 01:52:56.309
112T-007: Oh, I was gonna say, yeah, I can see how it's like problem number 6, A to the 4th times. v, 1,

899
01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:05.040
112T-007: you know, to to show how to how it could be written, and then say, explain why this process would work for any power of a or something like that.

900
01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:10.615
112T-008: Yeah, I was just gonna say, I

901
01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:18.207
112T-008: to follow up on Joshua's remarks. Number 3, a few above that has a couple of nice explained questions which

902
01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:21.639
112T-008: I think would be

903
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:23.469
112T-008: helpful. You could, even

904
01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:34.430
112T-008: in some of the later ones in Number 3 you could ask them to explain a little more, but A and B in number 3 have it explicitly. This is down in the exercises down at the end of the section.

905
01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:41.450
112T-008: Yeah, that that one, and I think Jennifer was talking about number 6 a couple below that.

906
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:45.419
112T-007: Oh, I was on the preview question.

907
01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:48.620
112T-008: Okay. Then at 8 to the 4th as well. Okay, I guess I was looking at this one.

908
01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:52.900
112R-003: But, Darren, which one in the exercises were you looking at.

909
01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:55.889
112T-008: 3 was what I was looking at with the explained questions.

910
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:09.100
112T-008: I also like the questions about I can

911
01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:13.239
112T-008: values and vectors of a a squared and a inverse, and

912
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:14.949
112T-008: things like that. So.

913
01:54:19.150 --> 01:54:24.330
112T-007: And I think it's important to do at this stage some of those kind of algebraic principles.

914
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:26.389
112T-007: because when they do.

915
01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:36.440
112T-007: when I mean in my experience. When the students do have the matrices later, right? They do just still want to do a to the 5th and calculate it, especially when they have sage.

916
01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:39.990
112T-007: And so I I really like kind of

917
01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:44.933
112T-007: building that principle early on that. You don't need to do that.

918
01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:50.520
112R-003: This is part of the math part of the math.

919
01:55:39.150 --> 01:55:40.310
112R-003: Okay.

920
01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:42.300
112R-003: unless anybody has

921
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:43.980
112R-003: ones that they're

922
01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:46.859
112R-003: that are burning a hole in their pocket

923
01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:48.580
112R-003: right at this moment.

924
01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:53.000
112R-003: I'm going to suggest we do 2 things.

925
01:55:53.210 --> 01:55:54.470
112R-003: one.

926
01:55:55.074 --> 01:55:58.949
112R-003: make sure that we link this into our

927
01:55:59.030 --> 01:56:02.610
112R-003: meeting log and kind of make explicit in our meeting log

928
01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:13.490
112R-003: and give ourselves a homework for next time to. Based on these thoughts set of ideas, question concepts in the sections and existing ones that we could springboard off of.

929
01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:25.640
112R-003: How do we feel about if between now and the next meeting which we'll that's part B, we need to schedule the next meeting. If we have a goal of everyone, try

930
01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:28.250
112R-003: to

931
01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:31.860
112R-003: propose one question for each of these sections.

932
01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:35.460
112R-003: and that way we'll have a pool of questions

933
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:38.529
112R-003: that we can give each other feedback on.

934
01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:52.380
112R-003: and see what kind of converges and trickles together when we come back, and maybe that's come up with a set of questions we'd like to throw out to some test students to see what happens when we actually put them out in the wild.

935
01:56:53.760 --> 01:57:00.569
112R-003: So I will link that into our meeting. I'll link this document. We've made lots of notes about questions that we like things that we'd like to see

936
01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:07.379
112R-003: in there and then. We really need to crack open our calendars and agree on when we're going to meet next. That's the next priority.

937
01:57:08.181 --> 01:57:10.889
112A-005: So so so you said

938
01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:12.570
112A-005: we should each

939
01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:14.550
112A-005: think of a question.

940
01:57:15.598 --> 01:57:25.470
112R-003: If we had, if our goal, if our goal was that every everybody can. And if you, it doesn't have to be this way, everybody comes up with 3 questions between now

941
01:57:26.450 --> 01:57:34.160
112R-003: by default, assuming that they're all there's like one for each section. But if you get really excited about linear independence, and all your questions are for linear independence. That's fine.

942
01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:36.910
112R-003: right? It's just. I'm just sort of suggesting a

943
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:38.669
112R-003: a starting place.

944
01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:47.562
112T-008: Is there any format for? The questions I mean, there is is open ended explained questions. Is that okay?

945
01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:52.790
112T-008: or are you looking for short answer, multiple choice kind of.

946
01:57:53.610 --> 01:58:03.859
112R-003: We're not we're looking at more things that require kind of a short answer component and explain that that explain piece that we keep circling around.

947
01:58:04.412 --> 01:58:05.829
112R-003: Is a focus.

948
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:06.480
112T-008: Okay.

949
01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:15.379
112R-003: And that may, as the teams go as things develop that it may, it may evolve differently than that. But that's where we're starting out, we'll see what actually shapes up.

950
01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:21.348
112A-005: So I put a link to this.

951
01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:23.810
112A-005: to the questions document in.

952
01:58:24.450 --> 01:58:25.979
112A-005: Okay, you've added it again.

953
01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:28.240
112R-003: I, just, I just did it.

954
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.169
112R-003: Did you do? Okay?

955
01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:42.420
112R-003: And then as for okay, so we also need a volunteer to be the note taker next time.

956
01:58:43.230 --> 01:58:43.915
112R-003: So

957
01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:52.690
112R-003: So next time, David, if you if you could be, we'll just kind of have this rotation. So, David, you can be the timekeeper next time.

958
01:58:52.890 --> 01:58:58.530
112R-003: and somebody else can be the note taper. We'll kind of like who would? Who would like to volunteer to be our next note taker.

959
01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:05.000
112T-008: I was. Gonna say, I can do it, but I think Josh was raising his hand so.

960
01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:05.820
112S-001: Yeah, I can be.

961
01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:09.180
112T-008: Happy to let let you do it so I can. I can volunteer later.

962
01:59:09.410 --> 01:59:10.040
112R-003: Great.

963
01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:12.810
112A-005: Thanks, Joshua.

964
01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:17.140
112R-003: And then what? So what?

965
01:59:17.250 --> 01:59:23.469
112R-003: Let's see what we're looking at time. Wise today is Monday, October 21.st So we're going to be meeting.

966
01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:26.550
112R-003: Our goal is to meet twice in November.

967
01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:34.335
112R-003: and so, presumably there

968
01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:39.560
112R-003: People may have family gathering considerations

969
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:42.680
112R-003: later on in the month. Obviously

970
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:47.849
112R-003: so, if we had a goal of meeting

971
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:57.339
112R-003: sometime during the week of November 4.th Is that possible for people? And then, if we met sometime in the week of November 18.th What do we think about that.

972
01:59:58.720 --> 01:59:59.730
112A-005: 4, th in the week of the 8.th

973
01:59:59.730 --> 02:00:00.330
112R-003: 18.th

974
02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.370
112A-005: I'm out of town.

975
02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:05.990
112A-005: Well, I come back into town like at 2 o'clock

976
02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:07.899
112A-005: on Monday, the 18, th

977
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:10.290
112A-005: so I know this time works, for

978
02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:14.739
112A-005: you know a lot of us. But the the 18th itself would not be good for me.

979
02:00:16.650 --> 02:00:17.400
112R-003: Okay.

980
02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:24.130
112R-003: what about for

981
02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:30.640
112R-003: the week of the 4? th What do people think as far as windows.

982
02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:35.999
112T-007: I can still do this time. On the Monday.

983
02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:38.509
112A-005: Yeah, this time works for me.

984
02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:41.350
112R-003: Bat channel. November 4.th

985
02:00:42.265 --> 02:00:42.930
112R-003: Okay.

986
02:00:45.690 --> 02:00:47.780
112R-003: that is my time.

987
02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:49.569
112R-003: That's 11 Am.

988
02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:52.620
112R-003: Great.

989
02:00:59.970 --> 02:01:01.689
112R-003: Okay, there is.

990
02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:06.440
112R-003: There is a place that we can put it in our notes down below.

991
02:01:09.970 --> 02:01:11.200
112R-003: and then

992
02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:14.299
112R-003: that Joshua will be our next note taker.

993
02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:23.159
112R-003: Okay? And then we can on on the 4.th When we meet we can talk about what things look like for our second meeting in November.

994
02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:25.929
112R-003: unless anybody wants to. Just like

995
02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:30.040
112R-003: really go gangbusters and try to nail it down right now.

996
02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:38.109
112T-007: I feel like we've also met on the Tuesday around this time, and I don't know if that still works. So maybe doing the 19th at this. At the

997
02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:41.319
112T-007: same time. I don't know if that worked for everybody.

998
02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:44.699
112R-003: It's a problem, for that's a problem for me.

999
02:01:45.330 --> 02:01:46.740
112R-003: I believe that

1000
02:01:48.170 --> 02:01:52.280
112S-002: Unfortunately the week of the 18.th I cannot.

1001
02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:59.289
112S-002: because I have dance till from 8 in the morning till 5 Pm. From that Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

1002
02:02:00.270 --> 02:02:02.280
112R-003: What about November 25? th

1003
02:02:04.330 --> 02:02:06.120
112R-003: Know it's a little bit later in the month.

1004
02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:08.510
112T-008: Works for me.

1005
02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:09.540
112T-007: I can do that.

1006
02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:10.280
112S-002: Works for me.

1007
02:02:10.670 --> 02:02:12.789
112R-003: Same time. November this.

1008
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:13.520
112A-005: That's great!

1009
02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:14.340
112R-003: Time. Slot.
